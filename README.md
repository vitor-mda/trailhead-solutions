## [Trailblazer Profile](https://trailblazer.me/id/vitor-mda "VÃ­tor's Trailblazer profile")

---

- ### Objective
This repository objective is to safekeep and showcase most code written by me to solve Trailhead modules, projects and superbadges.

**IN NO WAY I SUPPORT CHEATING!** Please, if you are having trouble solving any Trailhead challenge, ask the community for help.
Don't copy and paste other people's code. ðŸ˜‰

- ### Repository structure
Folders will be named according to the kind of content it will hold (modules, projects and superbadges).
They will also contain subfolders, one for each content item, using the respective URL as name.

Eg: for the [Build an Instant Notification App](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/workshop-platform-events) project, the folder structure will be ``projects/workshop-platform-events``.

Inside, you will find all FINAL code (classes, triggers, markups etc) written to solve the challenges.

- ### About projects
Even though projects coding activities are basically copy 'n paste, I'll try to customize/optimize the solution as much as I can.
Some codes won't work to pass the challenges, but it'll produce the same outcome.
